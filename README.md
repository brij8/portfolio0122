# A Portfolio Page

An HTML and CSS page to showcase my work.

-----

I don't know why or how, but the sitedraft repo is pushing to this repo. Must be something to do with using it as a template? I honestly don't understand how git commands in the sitedraft repo were being sent here. I was also getting linter errors I didn't understand, failures related to the 'html --fix' config.   

I am going to delete sitedraft and start over from scratch. I'm not going to use any templates or provided linters or files or anything from the LFZ sources. I'm going to install all that on my own, then copy the html/css work I've done and hope for the best.

wish me luck o7
